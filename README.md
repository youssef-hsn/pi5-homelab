# pi5-homelab

> A living documentation of my Raspberry Pi 5 homelab journey—optimized for minimal resource consumption, maximum learning, and pure tinkering fun.

## Philosophy

This repository is more than just a collection of configs and scripts. It's a **living record** of my homelab evolution, built on three core principles:

1. **Resource Efficiency First** - Every service, every config, every decision is made with resource consumption in mind. Raspberry Pi OS Lite provides the lean foundation, and every addition is carefully considered.

2. **Open Source by Default** - This is my reference, but it's also yours. If my setup changes significantly (different hardware, different approach), I'll fork this repo and maintain both versions open source. Knowledge should be shared, not hoarded.

3. **Learn by Doing** - This is a playground. Things will break, get rebuilt, and evolve. The documentation reflects real-world usage, not theoretical perfection.

## Hardware

- **Board**: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM)
- **Cooling**: Passive cooling fan only
- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)

*Note: If my hardware setup changes, I'll fork this repository to maintain separate documentation for different configurations.*

## What's Inside

This repository evolves with my homelab. You'll find:

- **Configuration files** for services I'm running
- **Setup scripts** and automation I've created
- **Documentation** of what works (and what doesn't) and why I chose certain options
- **Lessons learned** from experiments and failures
- **Resource usage notes** to help optimize your own setup

## Why This Exists

1. **Personal Reference** - When I need to set up another Pi 5, this is my go-to guide
2. **Knowledge Sharing** - If my experiments help someone else, that's a win
3. **Open Source Commitment** - Keeping it public keeps me accountable and helps the community
4. **Fun Documentation** - Because homelabbing should be enjoyable, not just functional

## Contributing

This is my personal homelab documentation, but I welcome:
- Questions and discussions
- Suggestions for improvements
- Issues if you find something that doesn't work
- Pull requests for fixes or enhancements

**Current Status**: 🚀 Actively maintained and updated as I experiment with new services and configurations.

*Last updated based on real-world usage, not theoretical planning.*
